## Second-hand Market Car Price Predictor ðŸš˜

Shopping for a used car can be challenging due to the complexity of factors like mileage, 
model, and engine type that influence its value. Without technical expertise, finding a 
reliable and reasonably priced car can be overwhelming, especially for newcomers in the 
market.

That is why I decided to create a machine learning model that makes it easy to spot hot
deals on the car market!

This project is based on a [DVM Car dataset](https://deepvisualmarketing.github.io/) containing 268255 car sale entries, with a 
detailed specification of the each sold car.

Currently I am working on exploratory analysis and cleanup of the data.

For now the leading idea is to utilize the k-nearest neighbors algorithm for predicting the prices.
