## Second-hand Market Car Price Predictor ðŸš˜

Shopping for a used car can be challenging due to the complexity of factors like mileage, 
model, and engine type that influence its value. Without technical expertise, finding a 
reliable and reasonably priced car can be overwhelming, especially for newcomers in the 
market.

That is why I decided to create a machine learning model that makes it easy to spot hot
deals on the car market!

This project is based on a [DVM Car dataset](https://deepvisualmarketing.github.io/) containing 
268255 car sale entries in the UK, with a detailed specification of each sold car. 

The two regression models that have been compared were k-nearest neighbors and random forest.

The entire project along with the detailed results have been summarised in form of a paper in report.pdf..
